Beehive, a textbook in English for Class IX, is based on the new syllabus in
English which was prepared as a follow-up to the National Curriculum
Framework, 2005. The curriculum calls for an approach that is rich in
comprehensible input and adopts a language-across-the-curriculum,
multilingual perspective. This reader aims at helping the child to read for
meaning, and to learn to communicate in English with confidence and
accuracy.
Care has been taken to give a central place to the learner in the process
of teaching and learning. Learner-friendly language has been used in
the instructions, and the exercises and activities are addressed to the
child. In this process the teacher is a facilitator or a co-learner.
A rich variety of reading material has been provided to include the literary,
cultural and sociological dimensions of texts. The themes range from
childhood and adolescence, to disability, talent and achievement, to
music, science, and contemporary social and environmental concerns.
The range is as inclusive as possible, keeping in view the interest and
cognitive development of the learners. The book draws on different genres
such as story, biography and autobiography; science fiction; humour;
travelogue; and the one-act play.
The number of poems has been increased to help learners explore this
great source of language, derive the joy of learning through poetry, and
understand the music of words. An attempt has been made to include
different types of poems such as the lyric, the ballad and the humorous
poem.1
